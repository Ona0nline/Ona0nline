            <h1>Dont hug me I'm scared</h1>
            <p>I'm into really odd things. I especially love listening
              to video essays (my favourite ones cover cults:How they started, how they ended...
              who survived etc.). This gif stands to represent the topic of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny5ar-S5AbE&t=1544s">one of my absolute favorite video essays</a>
              It has that "wtf is going on who thinks of this kind of stuff" kinda humour. Okie next gif>

          <h1>Princess Carolyn</h1>
          <p>I see myself as Princess Carolyn. Sevrely overworking herself,
            actually drowning herself in work to avoid her life. I wanted to divulge more but I got shy while typing. (Am I cool and mysterious yet??)

        <h1>Whisper of the heart</h1>
        <p>I have long been interested in anime but those days I didnt have a proper internet connection and so I couldnt stream stuff. The first anime I tried watching on youtube, was of people enjoying food to orgasmic ends. That turned me off. I grew up a bit and searched on Netflix (I knowwwww) and I found this beautiful (coming of age). This anime fully exposed my love for these "yearning for each other", "slow burn" kind of love stories.

          <h1>Marceline</h1>
          <p>If you really think about it, Marceline is literally an indie-rock artist. I was always drawn to her. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h28xpNvW9Yw">This</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA2PsADo11E">(and this)</a> wait <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpmDtouxwlI">this too</a> are my favorite songs of hers. Heavily inspired my music taste(core). yah.

          <div class="zima-text">
              <h1>Zima Blue</h1>
              <p>One of my favorite LDR episodes(so so so many to choose from). I think I liked how they explored themes of death, what it means to come back to yourself, the bravery that comes with starting over and the influence of art. I loved how they mirrored todays societal obsession with "shock factors"-to the point of us not even noticing that someone is literally killing themselves in front of us.
