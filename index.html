    <p class="intro">Welcome to my brain - plastered all over the internet. This is the homepage. If you are a returning
      visitor,
      you might be surprised to find that the background image has changed. This is because the background
      image (probably a collage) reflects my current state of mind. Most times the images mean nothing
      and I am simply into what I'm into. Other times it's a compilation of my current thoughts, desires
      and pieces of media that I am consuming at the time.

          <p>
            Today I decided to add an updates b0x.I also figured out how to add music and audio background to <a href="msc.html">a page</a>.
            When I say figured, thats way too much credit. It was..chatgpt. But heyyy
            look now we have a cool background thing. You may be asking yourself
            Gee whats up with this song? Well I chose it because it has an under tone of wallowing and self pity
            of which I hate to admit but I am a huge fan of. Anyway..if my mood changes, the song will change too.
            You can count on it.

        I decided to make music on this homepage an indefinite feature. Like most things on this page,
        the song of choice is subject to change. The song I chose to encapsulate
        my feelings on this phase of my life is called "Lurgee" by Radiohead.
        The lines that resonate with me are the repeated,"I feel better now", "I got better"
        "I feel better now, nothings wrong". Self explanatory. Oh and check out the newly added
        page <a class="sandbox-link" href="sandbox.html">"Sandbox"</a> to see my javascript experiments! Okie bye!

            Javascript is rucking me. According to my understanding so far, it's just a matter of remembering
            a whole bunch of strange syntax and all these teeny details. I will not be cramming all that lol.
            I think the strategy that makes most sense is to literally practice. Make websites with heavy javascript
            influence and literally "ask for help" (W3 schools) anytime I want to do something but IM CERTAIN
            an attribute or a method or whatever for it exists. I will say I am much more confident in my journey.
            None of it is easy but I feel more connected to it than ever before.

          Life is really giving like, a rainy day but it only rained for 2 hours
          and it's midday and you <em>could</em> probably go outside but it's too cold to. So you just sit.
          And rememeber you have a Monopoly game lying around somewhere.
          So much has happened. I'm on the waitlist for thee bootcamp that I really wanted/
          want to make it into. Hilariously enough, on the same day I got that news, I got acceptance
          for another bootcamp (fully online) that I wanted to get into like months ago. I literally
          forgot it exists. I push that everyday now and get certifications in the interim of me waiting for
          a response from..yeah. I have 2 so far. I also want to push my projects (this personal website included)
          and build my portfolio. I don't know how I feel really. I try to ignore my disappointment in
          the state of my life by piling myself with all these distractions (distractions that I actually enjoy
          partaking in mind you).
          On to website news, I have updated the film page (it looks really good) and I plan to 
          apply this same format to the music page as well. Also fix the music videos layout it is
          <em>GHASTLY</em>

        <p class="updates-heading5">31 August 2024 Update:

          Things are looking up. I hadn't updated for so long because I was busy with driving school
           and other projects.
          Since the last update, I "finished" the e-commerce site then I learnt Bootstrap cause I wanted
          to make the site responsive without learning the media face thing and it worked! One thing
          about that site is even though it's very amateur, it looks sexy on a phone. I gassed myself
          and hit up an advertsing agency on sumn "do you have room for one more?" and surprsingly it 
          went far lol. They asked for a portfolio and I made one over the weekend (womens day). After 
          going through it the CEO emailed me saying my work "displays talent and aesthetic prowess" (GASSED).
          What started as a joke ended up being an internship interview. Did I get the internship? No.
          They attributed it to me being a little too inexperienced. I don't blame them. I don't even 
          know React yet. I just wanted someone to see me, and they did.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          On other news, my laptop broke shortly after that like 2 weeks later. It fell on the floor and
          the screen "bones" popped out and in panick I spilled hot water all over the keyboard. It's fixed now
          obviously.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          I finally upgraded my package and I can keep doing SheCodes (ahhhhhhhhh) so that means this site
          is gonna be tweaked again! PERSONALLY I highly doubt it will be that hard because I have been 
          forced to teach myself lots of things like am I delusion or can I really do this in 3 1/2 months?
          If I can just get this done and get a remote/hybrid working job? It's over for everyone
