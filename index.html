    <p class="intro">Welcome to my brain - plastered all over the internet. This is the homepage. If you are a returning
      visitor,
      you might be surprised to find that the background image has changed. This is because the background
      image (probably a collage) reflects my current state of mind. Most times the images mean nothing
      and I am simply into what I'm into. Other times it's a compilation of my current thoughts, desires
      and pieces of media that I am consuming at the time.

            Today I decided to add an updates b0x.I also figured out how to add music and audio background to <a href="msc.html">a page</a>.
            When I say figured, thats way too much credit. It was..chatgpt. But heyyy
            look now we have a cool background thing. You may be asking yourself
            Gee whats up with this song? Well I chose it because it has an under tone of wallowing and self pity
            of which I hate to admit but I am a huge fan of. Anyway..if my mood changes, the song will change too.
            You can count on it.

        I decided to make music on this homepage an indefinite feature. Like most things on this page,
        the song of choice is subject to change. The song I chose to encapsulate
        my feelings on this phase of my life is called "Lurgee" by Radiohead.
        The lines that resonate with me are the repeated,"I feel better now", "I got better"
        "I feel better now, nothings wrong". Self explanatory. Oh and check out the newly added
        page <a class="sandbox-link" href="sandbox.html">"Sandbox"</a> to see my javascript experiments! Okie bye!

            Javascript is rucking me. According to my understanding so far, it's just a matter of remembering
            a whole bunch of strange syntax and all these teeny details. I will not be cramming all that lol.
            I think the strategy that makes most sense is to literally practice. Make websites with heavy javascript
            influence and literally "ask for help" (W3 schools) anytime I want to do something but IM CERTAIN
            an attribute or a method or whatever for it exists. I will say I am much more confident in my journey.
            None of it is easy but I feel more connected to it than ever before.

          Life is really giving like, a rainy day but it only rained for 2 hours
          and it's midday and you <em>could</em> probably go outside but it's too cold to. So you just sit.
          And rememeber you have a Monopoly game lying around somewhere.
          So much has happened. I'm on the waitlist for thee bootcamp that I really wanted/
          want to make it into. Hilariously enough, on the same day I got that news, I got acceptance
          for another bootcamp (fully online) that I wanted to get into like months ago. I literally
          forgot it exists. I push that everyday now and get certifications in the interim of me waiting for
          a response from..yeah. I have 2 so far. I also want to push my projects (this personal website included)
          and build my portfolio. I don't know how I feel really. I try to ignore my disappointment in
          the state of my life by piling myself with all these distractions (distractions that I actually enjoy
          partaking in mind you).
          On to website news, I have updated the film page (it looks really good) and I plan to 
          apply this same format to the music page as well. Also fix the music videos layout it is
          <em>GHASTLY</em>

          Things are looking up. I hadn't updated for so long because I was busy with driving school
           and other projects.
          Since the last update, I "finished" the e-commerce site then I learnt Bootstrap cause I wanted
          to make the site responsive without learning the media face thing and it worked! One thing
          about that site is even though it's very amateur, it looks sexy on a phone. I gassed myself
          and hit up an advertsing agency on sumn "do you have room for one more?" and surprsingly it 
          went far lol. They asked for a portfolio and I made one over the weekend (womens day). After 
          going through it the CEO emailed me saying my work "displays talent and aesthetic prowess" (GASSED).
          What started as a joke ended up being an internship interview. Did I get the internship? No.
          They attributed it to me being a little too inexperienced. I don't blame them. I don't even 
          know React yet. I just wanted someone to see me, and they did.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          On other news, my laptop broke shortly after that like 2 weeks later. It fell on the floor and
          the screen "bones" popped out and in panick I spilled hot water all over the keyboard. It's fixed now
          obviously.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          I finally upgraded my package and I can keep doing SheCodes (ahhhhhhhhh) so that means this site
          is gonna be tweaked again! PERSONALLY I highly doubt it will be that hard because I have been 
          forced to teach myself lots of things like am I delusion or can I really do this in 3 1/2 months?
          If I can just get this done and get a remote/hybrid working job? It's over for everyone

          The wallpaper changed. It's always bitter sweet but I think we're aware of the era that
          we're in right now. The theme before was very much cyber, bright over exaggerated colors, techy,
          bold..yea and that was because I was really excited to be fully immersed in this whole new
          world that I discovered (tech) and I just thought that was the coolest expression of it. Should 
          I start adding the old backgrounds? Should I make a whole page for that? YES.<br/><br/>
          Anyway, this new era we're in is the acceptance of loneliness and lack of social life 
          whilst heavily desiring deeper human connection - especially coming from "my person". Whom
          I have not met yet.Every piece of the collage reflects either what is or what's sought.<br/><br/>
          I'm almost done with SheCodes...I don't know how to feel. I think React is pretty cool so far
          though. I have alot more thoughts about alor more things but this website is not a secret! So until
          next time, If you are reading is, I just know you're precious to me❤️

          The Wallpaper changed again but this does not really reflect how I feel right now,
          it's more so how I felt during my first 4 months at WTC. Super tired, super sluggish...
          for some reason I was always quite insecure about the size of my stomach (I was eating)
          more because I had longer days. I have strongly neglected my guitar and the image just
          shows general things like me taking the bus..taking the train, moments I tried to replicate
          with my friends...I will be updating the wallpaper soon I just haven't jumped into a
          new state perse to the point whereby I would want to make a collage about it.<br><br>

          I'm getting locs on Monday!(Micro).<br/><br/>
          I started a new Webapp called Moodio and I am using it to expand on React and learn
          Tailwind + other cool libraries and technologies. Soon I will get to learning SQL and
          Firebase, maybe Node.js eventually, or just use Flask/Django for my backend stuff..<br/><br/>
          I'm part of the worship team (choir) at church now and I will be singing on 
          New years eve<br/><br/>
          I've been thinking about my 20th birthday alottt and I'm writing a list of 20 things
          I want to do before I turn 20:<br/>
          Complete Moodio,Get microlocs,Go on a dinner date,Thrift at Dunusa,Drive and park
          in Wonderpark,Drive alone,Make an e-commerce website,Make a cool engaging website,
          Go out for drinks with someone,Have a Clay Cafe date,Attend a concert....
          <br/><br/>
          These holidays (I believe) I have been working really hard. Trying to finish Cs50,
          learning algorithms, Moodio and very slowly starting Java. I pray to God that I not 
          only survive but thrive in this coming year.
          <br/><br/>
          Anyway, this year has been really hard. I get emotional thinking about it. I don't know
          how exactly I survived and tbh, I sometimes get anxious about hoping for things to come
          because of how disappointing and traumatic this year was. It's almost as if nothing
          is in my control so what's the point of hoping for anything. Whatever God has planned
          for me next year, I really hope there is much less suffering because I really don't think
          I can do this anymore.<br/><br/>
          If you are reading this, Happy New Year and I love you🎇💝

        </p>
        <p>
          Life is much much better than what I had imagined before the new year. I have very little
          if anything to complain about. I think I am doing pretty good with my school work, I have kinda
          slowed down with my ridesharing app because I don't have the time to complete it but asap I'll
          be back on it.<br><br>
          Although I have been doing pretty great with java, I am a bit saddened by the fact that I don't quite remember
          much regarding my front end business. I feel embarrased about it although I hear people say it's a normal
          thing that happens. Speaking of all that, I don't think I have been really connected with myself these days,
          especially creatively and websitely. I want to grow and expand this site so much, it's getting dusty
          around here. I want a page for my memories but explained through music. I want it to be like a garden...
          Shaun the sheep type style and all the elements will be moving around. And every thing you click on will have
          some kind of..."memorial"? Is that weird? Do I hold on to too much? But a few relevant songs will be attached to that
          memorial thing. Idk "memorial" sounds kinda drab. I also want to bring the music element back in this business.
          <br><br>
          I think I am going to be very busy these days (By the way I am on the Women Think Code committee).
          But I think that makes it all the more important for me to connect with myself. I havent watched anything
          that has TOUCHED me lately, I have been really touched by alot of gospel songs though, (Atmosphere Shift for one).
          Dang there is so much to say. I have microlocs now. I am in the worship team. I sing front vocals sometimes.
          I have many new lovely friends right here at home. I have been called to dress more modestly. 
          I havent played guitar in months but I feel a song coming. My digestive issues have greatly improved.
          I am still so connected to everything I have ever loved before. This years birthday is a huge deal to me
          and I expect TEARS. I have a boyfriend. I  I I I I I I I like my little life.
