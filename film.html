    <h2>City of God</h1>
    <h3>The city that breeds violence, and the kids who fight to survive</h3>
    <img src="7️⃣.jpeg" alt="film">

    <p>
      City of God is a riveting movie centered around gangs and ganglife, violence,
      resistance to such a life and basically the story, (beginning and end) of how 5 young men
      got into it the first place. Everything about it was so perfect. The way we are introduced to the characters,
      the way we follow through with them, panning back and forth, the narration, the tension that
      we feel through the screen! Perfection.

      <strong>Power:<br/></strong>
      This movie highlights the intoxicating effect of power. I think the most obvious character
      that displays this is Li'l Dice. The <em>obsession</em> with power that this kid had just drew
      me in. I was highly interested in seeing just how far he will go for what he wants. Outside of a gang
      life persepective, we see later on how insecure he actually feels and how he NEEDS 
      power, or rather taking other peoples power to soothe his fragile ego. The constant struggle for
      power was the driving force behind so many problems in this film.

    <p><strong>Love:</strong><br/>
      This is arguably not a strong theme but I do want to talk about it. The relationship between
      these two characters (I feel) displayed the naiviety of young relationships. They were
      both so in love but the relationship could not have worked unless Shaggy let go of his 
      criminal lifestyle and they basically ran away together(I am a <em>SUCKER</em>for a "lets run away"
      trope. Unfortunately what happened, happened but I really wish they made it) I can't really
      find pictures of a couple that I really want to talk about because they dont really exist and they more
      so overlap with themes of power? But if you know you know.

      <p>I think this relationship displayed two things: The desire to have something that you cannot
        have, and the beauty of what you can find when you allow yourself to not date "your type". 
        I think he couldn't really claim to have loved her he barely knew her but in the same breath,
        I think they could have been something special. Her next relationship was the same thing really.
        I also think he wasn't really ready for a mature relationship, he wanted it but he wasn't ready for it.
        I also don't blame her for not having the patience for him.

      <p>
        I love how their relationship displayed how love has the power to absolutely change you. I don't
        think that men will change for you I just think, the power of the love they have for you,can change 
        them. There's a quote actually: "Love is the ability to deny thyself and be engulfed in flames". I wasn't
        sure what to make of that quote but thinking intently about their relationship, I might say I agree...

      <p><strong>Brotherhood/Loyalty:</strong><br/>
        The balance between these two was beautiful to witness. Benny was the only person
        who could speak to Lil Ze and in turn I'd like to believe Lil Ze made sure that Benny is always
        safe. Looking back? I realise that Benny was really just in this life for the money. He wasn't
        into the drugs and the violence perse, whereas Lil Ze was consumed by the power that came with it
        (being a ruthless gang leader). I think it was sad how Lil Ze clearly struggled with expressing
        emotions. I think he was scared of being lonely (romantically and generally being without Benny)
        It was a beautiful thing to witness.

      To finish, there are so many characters to talk about but this would be way too long and I would 
      definitely spoil the movie. I am super into foreign films though so do expect more.

      <h4>Lady bird</h4>
        <h5>A movie about the turbulent journey of self-discovery, 
          family, and the bittersweet transition to adulthood.</h5>
        <img src="lady bird header.jpeg" alt="lady bird">
  
        <p>"Lady Bird" is a coming-of-age film that follows Christine "Lady Bird" McPherson, 
          a high school senior in Sacramento,
        California, as she navigates the trials and tribulations of adolescence. Struggling with her 
        strained relationship with
        her mother, Lady Bird dreams of escaping her small town and attending college on the East 
        Coast. The film explores
        themes of identity, family dynamics, friendship, and the pursuit of dreams, capturing the 
        poignant and often humorous
        moments of growing up. Through her journey, Lady Bird learns valuable lessons about love, 
        self-acceptance, and the
        meaning of home.</p>
  
        <p>
          <strong>Identity and Self-discovery:<br /></strong>
          
          Lady Bird has issues with her self image and defining who she is and who she wants to be.
          We see this firstly with the fact that she calls herself "Lady Bird". Usually when people 
          change their names like that, it's a sign as a desire to depersonalise yourself from your experience
          of being yourself. Whether that is for the protection of yourself and your "purest version" or
          for the fact that you simply don't like or accept who you naturally are so you want to create 
          an alter ego - another body in which you feel like you can exist in. We see this theme further driven
          in Lady Birds embarrasment in her home/family dynamic. I think I can also say i see it in how she 
          wanted to so badly impress that douchey cool kid guy. This theme so obviously touched me.
          <img class="ladybirdimg1" src="ladybird 1.jpeg" alt="Lady Bird">
        </p>
  
        <p><strong>Mother-daughter relationship:</strong><br />
          The constant and subtle yet sometimes very obvious conflict between Lady Bird and her mother
          was so emotionally streinous to watch. The frustration that Lady Birds mother constantly felt
          towards Lady bird for reasons that I dont think she fully understood mixed with Lady Birds constant
          feeling of "never being enough" for her mother was difficult to see on screen. I think lady bird 
          decided to do life on her own without any motherly input and she eventually made it out but upon
          maturing, she realised she needed her mother after all. I think that's beautiful.

          </div>

  
        <p><strong>Search for belonging:</strong><br />
          Lady Birds' deep belief that she was "born in the wrong city" and she "needs to" move to New York
          was so relatable. I was so sure that my home was in Cape Town/Stellenbosch and I cannot lie
          I genuinely did feel at home and I was right I did belong much better in the Cape I think 
          but damn did I not lose myself a little (just like Lady Bird). I can draw a parallel between
          Lady Bird and I in how she introduced herself as "Christine" which I think symbolized growth,
          maturity and a sense of self acceptance. I think people who scroll through alter egos eventually
          reach a point where they desire to explore who they are at the core-they get tired of running from themselves.
          I see that mirrored in the movie in the fact that I go by my real, first name now.

        <p>
          I don't think the other themes I wish to mention require their own headings. These are:<br/>
          <strong>Class and socio-economic status<br/></strong>being the driving force behind why 
          Lady Bird felt so ashamed of herself and did so much to try to impress people she thought
          were better than her.<br/>
          <strong>Sacrifice and love:<br/></strong>
          We see Marion (Lady Birds mom) unconditional love towards Lady Bird. Despite the familys' financial
          struggle, she made sure that they were good. Even though she had so much resentment 
          towards Lady Bird due to her betrayal, she still felt so much love and wanting to see her off.
          I think we see the difficulties of expressing love to someone once you have built these strong
          walls on your heart. It's difficult to break down. However we see that when you love someone enough,
          you find the strength to overcome it.<br/>Also Lady Birds' first relationship was so sweet to witness.
          It was beautiful to see love overcome once again, allowing Lady Bird to be a friend to her ex even after
          finding out what she found out.

          To conclude, this film is literally my favourite. I hate repeating movies but I have
          seen this one about 5 times now. I also enjoy watching films that I heavily relate to and I 
          love watching movies that make me FEEL something, especially if that emotion is melanchony.<br/>
          I don't know why.
